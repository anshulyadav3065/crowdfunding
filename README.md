# 🌱 GreenFund

## 📘 Project Description
GreenFund is a decentralized crowdfunding platform built on the Ethereum blockchain.  
It enables users to create and fund eco-friendly projects with full transparency and security.  
Creators can launch campaigns, and supporters can contribute directly using cryptocurrency.

## 🌍 Project Vision
To drive global environmental impact by empowering individuals and organizations to support green initiatives through decentralized finance (DeFi).  
Our goal is to build a transparent, trustless, and borderless ecosystem for sustainable development.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Create Projects:** Anyone can launch a new eco-friendly project with a funding goal.  
- **Fund Projects:** Contributors can fund projects directly with ETH.  
- **On-Chain Transparency:** All transactions and project data are stored on the blockchain for full visibility.  
- **Auto Completion:** Projects are automatically marked as complete when their funding goal is reached.  

---

## 🔮 Future Scope
- **Milestone-Based Funding:** Implement staged fund releases as projects progress.  
- **Reputation System:** Add creator credibility scores and funder ratings.  
- **Multi-Chain Expansion:** Support multiple blockchains for global reach.  
- **Governance Token:** Launch a native token for rewards, voting, and DAO governance.

## 🧠 How It Works
1. A user deploys the GreenFund contract.  
2. Project creators can call `createProject()` to list a new project with a funding goal.  
3. Supporters call `fundProject()` and send ETH directly to the project creator.  
4. Once the goal is reached, the project automatically marks as **completed**.
